<!--Client-side Validation: JavaScript-->

<!--Client-side validation has two main advantages. First, it’s a better experience for the user to be alerted to
problematic data immediately rather than having to wait for that information to come back from the server and have to
fill out the form again. Second, catching mistakes earlier in the process saves the application time and resources as
well. But not all issues can be handled with the built-in HTML validations.-->

<!--In order to truly customize validation or to perform more complex validations, we can incorporate JavaScript form
validations. We can do this by either writing the JavaScript ourselves or by incorporating a JavaScript library. If we
have unique requirements for usernames on our site, for example, we’ll have to provide these systems of validation
ourselves.-->

<!--If we’re creating a relatively simple website, it makes sense to code the form validation ourselves or use a simple
vanilla JavaScript library "just-validate" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/just-validate), for example.
But most basic validation libraries will involve directly accessing or manipulating the DOM. This can get tricky when
working with a framework that relies on a virtual DOM—like React or Vue. In those situations, it might be best to
incorporate a library that works well with your specific framework. For example,
the formik library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) is a lightweight library that simplifies validating forms
in a React app.-->

<!--Play around with the website we’ve provided. It’s a password validator with some specific requirements. This
validation is done completely on the client-side using JavaScript. Specifically, it uses a library called Parsley.js.-->
