//Rerouting
//
//In this lesson, we’ve learned some basic tools to validate HTML forms on the back-end using PHP. We learned how to send meaningful feedback to our users when their inputs are invalid. But what should we do if the user has submitted a valid form?
//
//    So far, we’ve been sending the users back to the same form whether there were errors in their submission or not. We’ve indicated the form was successfully submitted by conditionally displaying a message, but this isn’t always a great user experience. Think of what happens when you log in to your email. Usually, once a form has been submitted successfully, the user is rerouted to an entirely different page.
//
//We can use the PHP
// header()
// function to perform redirects. We call the
// header()
// function on a string that begins with "Location: ", followed by the URL we want to redirect the user to. For example:
//"Location: https://www.best-puppy-pix.com/".
// After invoking the header() function we’ll want to use the language construct exit to terminate the current script.
//
//To work properly, the
// header()
// function needs to be run before anything is output by the script. This includes HTML. So we’ll include it in our PHP
// script before our file outputs any HTML:

if ( "The submission data is validated..." ) {
    header("Location: https://www.best-puppy-pix.com/");
    exit;   // stop the script after redirecting to the new page
}

//Awesome. Let’s try it out!
