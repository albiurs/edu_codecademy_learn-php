//What are Classes?
//
//    In the previous exercise, we asked you to imagine a class for pets. Let’s see how we would actually create a PHP Pet class.
//
//To define a Pet class, we use the class keyword followed by the class name (typically title cased in PHP) and curly brackets:

//class Pet {
//
//}

//Within the curly brackets, we can add properties, which define the data each object of the class will contain. The syntax is similar to how we define variables:

//class Pet {
//    public $name, $color;
//}

//Note: The public keyword has to do with something called visibility. We’ll discuss this in depth later in the lesson.

<?php

class Beverage {

    public $color, $opacity, $temperature;
}
