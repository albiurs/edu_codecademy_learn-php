//Methods
//
//In addition to properties, we can define class methods – essentially functions each object will contain. Methods are frequently used to interact with an object’s properties in a defined manner.
//
//Methods are defined with the same syntax we use when declaring functions (except they are defined within the curly brackets of a class).
//
//Given a Pet class with first and last name properties, we could provide a method which returns the two properties combined into a full name:

class Pet {
    public $first, $last;
    function getFullName() {
        return $this->first . " " . $this->last;
    }
}

//The $this variable refers to the current object; when we invoke this method, $this refers to the specific object that called the method.
//
//Methods are accessed in a similar fashion to properties, using the object operator (->), but in order to invoke them, use parentheses at the end:

$my_object->classMethod();

//So, to access the full name of our Pet, we can use the following:

$very_good_groundhog = new Pet2();
$very_good_groundhog->first = "Punxsutawney";
$very_good_groundhog->last = "Phil";
echo $very_good_groundhog->getFullName(); # Prints "Punxsutawney Phil"

?>
