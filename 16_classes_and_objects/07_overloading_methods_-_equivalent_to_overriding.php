//Overloading Methods (equivalent to "overriding" in other programming languages)
//
//Sometimes, we want to change how methods behave for subclasses from the original parent definition. This is called
// overloading a method. To do this, define a new method within the subclass with the same name as the parent method.
//
//For example, our Pet class might have a type method:

class Pet {
    function type() {
        return "pet";
    }
}

//But in our Dog class, we want to update this message:

class Dog extends Pet2{
    function whatIsThis() {
        return "dog";
    }
}

//We can call the parent’s definition of the method within the subclass using parent:: followed by the method name:

class Dog2 extends Pet2{
    function type() {
        return "dog";
    }

    function classify(){
        echo "This " . parent::type() . " is of type " . $this->type();
        // Prints: This pet is of type dog
    }
}
