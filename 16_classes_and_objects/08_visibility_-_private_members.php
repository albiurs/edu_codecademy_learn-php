//    Visibility - Private Members
//
//To understand visibility we need to think about how classes will be used in complex programs—in large applications, a
// class might be used in diverse situations (passed around inside functions and used in code written by numerous
// developers). When we think about our classes being used in many situations, we’ll want to consider restricting
// access to certain member data.
//
//Up to this point, we’ve been using public visibility for properties. This is also the default visibility for methods.
// A public visibility means members can be accessed from within the object or from outside it. But sometimes we’ll want
// a member to only be accessible from within the object. To do this, we can declare this member private.
//
//Let’s look at an example:

class Pet {
    private $healthScore = 0;
    function exercise(){
        $this->healthScore++;
    }
    function feed(){
        $this->healthScore++;
    }
    function healthCheck(){
        if ($this->healthScore >= 2){
            echo "This is a healthy pet!";
        } else {
            echo "This is an unhealthy pet";
        }
    }
}

//In the code above, we have the property healthScore. This is a number we use to calculate the health of a pet.
// The healthScore property can be manipulated and accessed by member methods, but since we never want the property to
// be accessed directly outside of the class, we set the property as private. If an attempt is made to access the
// property directly, our code will raise a Fatal Error.
